# Product Roadmap

## Vision
Provide a modular multi-agent framework that streamlines software development tasks through clear role separation.

## High-Level Objectives
- Document core architecture and establish coding conventions.
- Deliver a usable dashboard with environment setup guidance.
- Automate testing and deployment workflows.
- Enable modular extensions for additional agent roles.
- Harden security and add audit logging.
- Enable autonomous task discovery and processing via Auto-Planner and Triggers.

## Stakeholder Feedback
- Early adopters requested clearer onboarding and API security guidance.
- Stakeholders emphasised the need for beta feedback prior to v1.0.
- See `docs/beta-feedback.md` for the survey template, interview plan, and tracking.
